                    <p class="chapter__text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                        applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use
                        JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of
                        your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about
                        React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                <section id="React" class="chapter">
                    <h2 class="chapter__title">React Fundamentals<sup>Chapter 3</sup>
                    </h2>
                    <p class="chapter__text">React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user
                        interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React
                        itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                    <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                        JavaScript
                        like so:
                        <br>
                        <span class="gray-bg">
                            &lt;Text&gt; Hello, I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX
                        is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
                            class="gray-bg">name</span> for the cat, name,
                        and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="gray-bg"> &lt;Text&gt;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>+ props</b>. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                    <p><b>+ state</b>. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                        render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data
                        that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
                    </p>

                <section id="Input" class="chapter">
                    <h2 class="chapter__title">Handling Text Input <sup>Chapter 4</sup>
                    </h2>
                    <p class="chapter__text"> TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has
                        an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an
                        onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
